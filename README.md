**Project Title:**
Spain-Based Job Board App

**Project Description:**

The client requested a job board app designed for admin-posted jobs in Spain. The app, similar to LinkedIn, allows only admins to post jobs, while users can apply to the jobs posted by the admins. Admins will then select candidates based on the applications.

Development was paused during the creation of the job module's backend, pending the client's advance payment, which was expected within 1-2 weeks. As a result, the repository includes a completed authentication module, with the job module being a work-in-progress in a separate branch.

While this project did not offer significant new technical challenges (as CRUD operations were already familiar), it provided a valuable lesson in securing advance payments or having a work contract in place (such as through Upwork or Fiverr) before beginning any development work. This is a lesson I will carry forward in my career.
