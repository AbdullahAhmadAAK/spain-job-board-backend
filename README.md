Explanation of Each Folder and File
/api
This folder is responsible for managing external API interactions if applicable. It contains modules that interface with third-party services or external APIs to fetch or send data.

/helpers
The helpers folder contains utility functions or reusable logic that assist in the application's operations, such as formatting dates, managing validation, or other common tasks shared across various modules.

/middleware
This folder holds middleware functions. Middleware functions are used to handle request/response modifications before they reach the routes or after the response is sent back. Common examples include authentication, logging, error handling, and role-based access control.

/routes
This folder organizes the various API route files. Each role and feature has its own dedicated subfolder to handle specific routes.

/routes/admin: Handles routes accessible to the admin role.
/routes/superadmin: Handles routes accessible to the superadmin role.
/routes/users: Handles routes accessible to regular users.
/routes/components: Handles routes for other modular components in the application.
/serializers
The serializers folder holds logic for formatting and transforming the data before sending it in the API response. Each role and component has its own dedicated serializer to ensure data is returned in the appropriate format.

/serializers/admin: Contains serializers for admin-specific responses.
/serializers/superadmin: Contains serializers for superadmin-specific responses.
/serializers/users: Contains serializers for user-specific responses.
/serializers/components: Contains serializers for different components in the application.
app.js
This is the entry point of the application. It sets up the Express server, loads middleware, initializes routes, and configures the application to start listening for requests.

This architecture ensures modularity and scalability, allowing for easy expansion or changes while keeping the structure clean and maintainable. Each role or component is properly separated, making it simple to implement role-specific behaviors and data formatting.
